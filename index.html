    <h4>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. These tasks range from logical reasoning and problem-solving to learning from experience, recognizing patterns, understanding language, and perceiving the environment. AI is not a single technology but a combination of fields, including computer science, mathematics, and engineering, working together to create intelligent machines capable of adapting to new situations and performing complex functions.

      AI is commonly divided into narrow AI and general AI. Narrow AI, which is the prevalent form today, focuses on specific tasks like facial recognition, language translation, or autonomous driving. General AI, a more advanced form, aims to replicate human-like cognitive abilities across a wide range of tasks, but it remains largely theoretical.
      
      Key subfields of AI include machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and expert systems. Machine learning enables computers to learn from data, identifying patterns and making predictions without being explicitly programmed. Natural language </h4>

        <h4>processing allows machines to interpret and respond to human language, powering voice assistants and chatbots. Computer vision allows AI systems to analyze and interpret visual data, enabling tasks like object recognition and self-driving cars. Robotics, combining AI with hardware, creates machines capable of interacting with the physical world, such as robotic arms or autonomous vehicles. Expert systems mimic the decision-making abilities of human experts in specific fields like healthcare or law.
          AI is revolutionizing industries such as healthcare, finance, education, and entertainment. It offers tremendous potential, from enhancing medical diagnoses to optimizing business processes. However, as AI becomes more pervasive, ethical concerns regarding privacy, security, and fairness are critical issues to address.</h4>
