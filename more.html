The initiative was undertaken during an AI-focused course at a secondary school in Västerås, Sweden. The primary objective was to gain practical experience with AI tools and assess their effectiveness in creating functional and visually appealing digital platforms. Artificial Intelligence was primarily used to assist with JavaScript and Java development throughout the project.
